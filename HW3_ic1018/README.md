# Assignment1
I coordinated with Ben Steers on this assignment, specifically to create empty container 'dictionary {} instead of using dictionary used by the professor.
1. Generated 100 samples with varying sample sizes (10 < N < 2000) from 5 different distributions : Chi Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Logistic.
2. Created an empty container 'dictionary {}' to hold all the distributions.
3. Demonstrated Central Limit Theorem and Law of large numbers by plotting sample means as a function of sample size. 
4. Plotted Histograms to show the sample means' distribution for all distributions individually.
5. Doubled the mymean for n in binomial distribution to adjust the center plot around the mean 100. Initially when I set my n = mymean, the plot was skewed and was centered around mean 50.0.
6. Combine and ploted the sample means of all distributions on a histogram.
7. Fited a gaussian curve to the above sample mean distribution.

# Assignment2
I coordinated with Ben Steers on this assignment, to mutually agree over the data selection and the category to plot against the date column.
1. Followed example from citibikes_gender.ipynb by Professor Federica - Formulated null and alternative hypothesis.
2. Chose 'usertype' category from the data frame and created a seperate dataframe called 'data' after dropping all the missing values.
3. Used 'starttime' as the 'date' and dropped all other columns except 'usertype' and 'date'.
4. Showed the data in tabular form and plotted out : Absolute Counts of Citibike bikers by usertype in January 2015, Absolute count of Citibike bikers by usertype in January 2015 with statistical errors, and Normalized distribution of Citi Biky users by user type in January 2015.

# Assignment3
I took advice from Ben Steers to calculate the Z score in this assignment.
1. Set a null and alternative hypothesis.
2. Peformed the Z test to check that if there is decrease in the new bus commute time as compared to the old bus commute time.
