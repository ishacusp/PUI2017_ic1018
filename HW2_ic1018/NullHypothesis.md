Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:
H0 : P0<=P1
H1 : P0>P1

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Null Hypothesis : People who diet have equal or more fat than the people who exercise
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
H0 : P_diet>=P_exercise
H1 : P_diet<P_exercise

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Null Hypothesis : Children of smokers have same or higher IQ than the children of non-smokers.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.
H0 : P_smokers>=P_nonsmokers
H1 : P_smokers<P_nonsmokers

Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
Null Hypothesis:Food deserts contribute same or less to the incidence of diabetes than the parts of the countries than don't have food deserts
H0 : P_fooddeserts<=P_nonfooddesert
H1 : P_fooddeserts>P_nonfooddesert
