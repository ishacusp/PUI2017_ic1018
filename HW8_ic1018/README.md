Figure 1: Color Map showing the Hong Kong Hourly Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) at different
Air Quality Monitoring stations for October 2017. The AQHI is recorded by HK-Environmental
Protection Department (HK). The AQHI informs the short-term health risk of air pollution
and helps the people to precautionary measures to protect your health.The AQHIs are
reported on a scale of 1 to 10 (ranging from low risk to high risk). The darker the
color of the grid, the higher is the AQHI and health-risk. The figure shows that
AQHI is at its peak in the evening hours (4 to 8), as these are the time when 
people are going back home or travelling for leisure. As HK is a vibrant city specifically 
in the evening and night, it is usually very crowded in the evening and the night time. Places 
like Central and Causeway Bay (Causeway bay - also a very tourist - rich area) are central business
district and partying areas, and hence are very crowded during the evening and night. Mong Kong is a 
shopping paradise and hence people usually go there in the evening. Tuen Mun and Tung Chung are
shopping + residential areas, and people generally like to spend a lot of time outside during the evening.
