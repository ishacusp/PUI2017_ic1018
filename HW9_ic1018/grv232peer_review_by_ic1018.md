CLARITY: 
The plot is pretty easy to read  and understand. It gives the useful information I need. However I got stuck on understanding 'AIDS main cause of dead men ages 25-44'. This text caption on the graph is not clear and well-formed to convey the appropriate meaning. To understand the meaning, I had to read the description (plot caption) and go through the jupyter notebook. Also, when I read this text caption, it makes me confused that whether the graph conveys number of deaths due to AIDS or the total number of deaths in a particular year. However the title suggests that it is depicting specifically total number of deaths due to AIDS, making this caption unclear. I also dont understand if the plot is showing number of deaths within age limit 25 - 44 specifically. I would perhaps improve the plot title to make it clear of what age range is covered, and point out the sudden rise in the number of deaths by either using arrow or circle over the particular plot area. (As shown in Figure 1 of https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a2.htm - refering to the arrow depiction shown in the figure)

ESTHETIC:
The plot is pretty aethetic and have a good propotion of information depiction vs graphical content. The color choice is also apt and easy to distinguish and not distracting. However, the colors in the graph are not colorblind friendly, and hence could be changed to include colorblind readers as well(that is, to not use red, green and blue together).

# FBB good

HONESTY:
The plot is honest, and doesn't deform the information. The number of deaths due to AIDS information for different sex/sex orientation is plotted out as it is.

Overall Good Work!

the 'AIDS main cause of dead men ages 25-44' label is aligned to a portion of the "Total" time series which I do not think is the right portion of the plot: as it is it reads that AIDS was the main cause of theadh from the beginning of that slope to its end, while likely it was the main cause of death around the pick, extending left and right from it. A good way to display it would be a horizontal bar that indicates the time range when AIDS is the leading cause of death on top of the time series, and the lable goes on top of it horizontally. There is also a typo: it should be death instead of dead -> this affects clarity and may also be used to dishonestly represent the importance of AIDS as a contributor to death if it is intended to suggest that AIDS always is the main contributor when it is in fact not

# FBB 
labels are way too small, especially considering the large amount of empty space in the plot

10/10
