![Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31747292/32814505-8845db9e-c97d-11e7-867e-d637639a67f8.png)

CLARITY: 
The plot is nice and simple. The X and Y axis has proper lables with the units. I can have a higher level understanding of the relationship between Condominium Property Age and its value in Manhattan through the plot. However there is no explanation given about the sudden rise or dip in the property value with respect to age. The title of the plot is missing and the caption is not well-informative.

ESTHETIC:
The plot is pretty aesthetic and have a good propotion of information depiction vs graphical content. The color choice is also apt and easy to distinguish and not distracting. The blue color could be changed to target the plot for colorblind readers as well. However, this is not important in this case since the plot only uses single color.

HONESTY:
The plot is honest, and doesn't deform the information. However, the Manhattan Condominium Property Age is calculated with respect to 2011 (I understood this after going through the jupyter notebook), which is no where mentioned in the plot or its description. There is also no reason given of why 2011 is chosen as base year to calculate the property age.

SUGGESTION:
I would suggest to have a title and a well-informed caption for the plot. The caption should mention that property age is calculated with respect to 2011, and perhaps the range of years covered, and sudden increase or decrease in the property value (specifically at 75 and 150 property age).
