a) Verify null and alternative hypoWomen are less likely than men to choose biking for commutingtheses:
Idea: Women are less likely than men to choose biking for commuting

The idea looks good and coherent. The null hypothesis in my view, should have been reversed :

"The ratio of women biking on weekends over women biking on weekdays is the same or higher than the ratio of men biking over weekends to men biking on weekdays"
as we want to know whether women bikes less than men, and hence the null hypothesis should be reversed. Also it would have been better if it was given in the terms of weekday count over the weekend count, because people bike a lot more for commute during the week than the weekend.

A better hypothesis which helps in assessing the 'Idea' after taking in the above two suggestions would be following:

"The ratio of women biking on weekdays over women biking on weekend is the same or higher than the ratio of men biking over weekdays to woman biking on weekend"

The alternative hypothesis would therefore be reversed in this case and would be following:
"The ratio of women biking on weekdays over women biking on weekend is less than the ratio of men biking over weekdays to men biking on weekend"

b) Verify that the data supports the project

He has used the temporal data provided by the CitiBike quite well. However he has taken 'January' month data to do his analysis, which is usally a very cold month and hence the number of people taking the citibikes might be small. Hence the dataset for testing the hypothesis might not be sufficient to reach conclusions. I would rather use some spring/fall month data when the temperature is milder and in normal range and hence more number of might bike.

c) Appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked

As the test involves to compare the differences between the two categorical variables, I would rather choose Chi sqaure test for association (based on the flow chart in the slide). 

d) Additonal Comments
Overall, hypothesis testing look fine. He can perhaps join multiple months data to have a bigger dataset to address the 'Idea', instead of sorely relying on one particular month data.
