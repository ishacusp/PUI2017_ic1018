# Assignment 1
For this Assignment, I followed the professor requirements to review Andrew Nell Cikibike assignment. I worked alone on this assignment as required.
I first forked and cloned Guobing Chen repository but found out he has removed the hypothesis testing from his file few days ago. I then changed to review Andrew's work.

# Assignment 2
In this assignment, I took Ben's massive help and advice to find articles to read on [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and fill 
in the contents of the statistical test table.

# Assignment 3
In this assignment, I work independently for the most part, specifically to reproduce the results. Ocassionally took help from Gaurav for
the TODO part for the z score calculations.

# Assignment 4
In this assignment, I took help from Ben to analyze the findings and for Pearson's test for correlation, specifically took Gaurav's help for
PART 2 : to determine the boroughs on the basis of coordinates.
