Assignment 1:

I worked with Ben Steers in this assignment, but we did our own work. We also discussed the findings and summary of the results with 
each other. 

I loaded the csv file - stored as nrg by creating a function getCSV. I loaded the PLUTO data - csv file - stored in bsize, using another 
method (used geopandas command here). I performed data processing, visualized energy consumption against number of units in the building.
I performed linear regression for both the two scenarios (reversing the dependent and independent variable), to find which model fits the
data best. I used chisquare for comparison. Later I performed polynomial regression, and used log-likelihood test for the comparison with the linear regression model.
